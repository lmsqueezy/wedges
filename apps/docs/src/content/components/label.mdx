### API Reference

Extends the <a href="https://www.radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/components/label" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">Radix Label</a> primitive and includes all of its props.

#### Label

<PropsTable
  content={[
    [
      {
        value: "asChild",
        description:
          "Change the default rendered element for the one passed as a child, merging their props and behavior.",
      },
      { value: "boolean" },
      { value: "false" },
    ],
    [
      { value: "htmlFor", description: "The id of the element the label is associated with." },
      { value: "string" },
      {},
    ],
    [
      {
        value: "tooltip",
        description: "Optional description of the label, shown on hover.",
      },
      { value: "ReactNode" },
      {},
    ],
    [
      { value: "description", description: "Additional information displayed next to the label." },
      { value: "ReactNode" },
      {},
    ],
    [
      {
        value: "required",
        description:
          "If set to `true`, the label will be styled to indicate that the field associated with the label is required.",
      },
      { value: "boolean" },
      { value: "false" },
    ],
    [
      {
        value: "disabled",
        description:
          "If set to `true`, the label will be styled to indicate that the field associated with the label is disabled.",
      },
      { value: "boolean" },
      { value: "false" },
    ],
  ]}
/>

#### Label.Helper

Renders supplementary information, typically displayed below the label. In addition to the `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLSpanElement>` props, it also accepts the following:

<PropsTable
  content={[
    [
      {
        value: "error",
        description:
          "If set to `true`, the helper label will be styled to indicate that the field associated with the label has errors. Alternatively, you can set `aria-invalid` to `true`.",
      },
      { value: "boolean" },
      { value: "false" },
    ],
    [
      {
        value: "disabled",
        description:
          "If set to `true`, the label will be styled to indicate that the field associated with the label is disabled.",
      },
      { value: "boolean" },
      { value: "false" },
    ],
  ]}
/>
