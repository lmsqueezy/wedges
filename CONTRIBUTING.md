# Contributing to Wedges

ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! We're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to Wedges. Before submitting your contribution, please take a moment to read through this guide.

## Repository Structure

Our repository is managed with [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/). Make sure you have PNPM installed to work with this repository.

It is structured as a [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) monorepo and it contains two main directories:

1. **packages/wedges**:
   This is the heart of our project â€“ the UI library itself. Here you'll find all the components, utilities, TailwindCSS plugin and core functionality of the Wedges UI library.

2. **apps/docs**:
   Contains the NextJS documentation site for the Wedges UI library. This is where we maintain the documentation, examples, and guides for using the library.

## Tooling and Technologies

In the Wedges project, we utilize a variety of tools to ensure code quality, consistency, and smooth development processes.

- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**: for code formatting. Our codebase adheres to the configuration specified in `.prettierrc`.

- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)**: for code linting. Make sure to check and fix any linting issues before submitting your code.

- **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)**: for testing. We encourage writing tests for new features and bug fixes.

- **[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)**: for Git hooks. It ensures that linters, and other checks are passed before commits and pushes.

- **[tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev/)**: for bundling the library files. We bundle both ESM and CJS versions of the library.

- **[Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets)**: for changelog generation and release management.

## Commit Convention

Our project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for commit messages.

When preparing your commits for a Pull Request, ensure they adhere to our commit message format: `type(scope): description`. The `type` and `scope` help categorize the commit, making our history readable and organized.

### Types of Commits

Your commits should fall into one of the following categories:

- `feat` (or `feature`): Introduces new code or functionality to the project.

- `fix`: Addresses and resolves a bug. Linking to an issue if available is highly encouraged.

- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature, but improve the existing codebase.

- `docs`: Updates or additions to documentation, such as README files, usage guides, etc.

- `build`: Changes affecting the build system, including dependency updates and additions.

- `test`: Modifications involving tests, including adding new tests or refining existing ones.

- `ci`: Adjustments to our continuous integration setup, like GitHub Actions or other CI tools.

- `chore`: General maintenance and organizational tasks that don't fit other categories.

For example, a commit message might look like: `feat(components): introduce new Button styles`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Branch Workflow

- Develop in dedicated branches, not directly on the `main` branch.

- Use descriptive names for your branches.

### Checks and Tests

- Ensure GitHub Actions pass before submitting your PR. Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` before pushing your branch.

- Ideally add tests for new features or bug fixes.

### Commits in PRs

- It's okay to have multiple small commits in your PR.

- We'll squash the commits when merging into `main`.

- Follow our [Commit Convention](#commit-convention).

### Adding New Features

- Provide tests for new features.

- Discuss new features in an issue or discussion topic before coding.

### Fixing Bugs

- Describe the bug in detail in your PR.

- Include steps to reproduce or a live demo if possible.

- Link the issue your PR fixes, using the format `fix #issue_number`.

Remember, clear and detailed PRs help us efficiently review and integrate your contributions!

### Updating Documentation

- For every code change, especially API modifications or new features, ensure corresponding updates in documentation.

- You'll find our documentation in the `apps/docs/src/content` folder. We are using MDX format which allows us to embed JSX components within markdown.

- Wedges components are available to use in the mdx files.

## Creating a Pull Request (PR)

1. **Fork and Clone**: Begin by forking the main repository and cloning your fork.

2. **Branching**: Create a new branch off `main` using the format `[type/scope]`, like `feat/button-enhancement` or `docs/update-readme`. The `type` should align with conventional commit types.

3. **Development**: Make your changes and commit them adhering to the [commit guidelines](#commit-convention). Use `pnpm build` to test your changes.

4. **Document Changes**: Run `pnpm changeset` for a detailed change description. For minor updates (like CI changes), use `pnpm changeset add --empty`.

5. **Prepare for Submission**:

   - Use `pnpm dev` to start the development server
   - Use `pnpm build` to run tests and linters and to make sure your code builds without errors.
   - Ensure your Node version is 16 or higher.

### Submitting Your PR

6. **Final Steps**:

   - Ensure all tests pass and the package builds correctly.
   - Push your branch and open a PR to `main`.

### Available pnpm Commands

- `pnpm dev`: Starts the NextJS development server for the documentation site and tsup in development mode for the library.

- `pnpm build`: Creates production builds of the library and documentation site. It also runs linting checks.

- `pnpm lint`: Executes ESLint across the entire repository.

- `pnpm lint:fix`: Runs ESLint and fixes fixable issues throughout the repository.

- `pnpm format`: Executes Prettier for code formatting across the repository.

- `pnpm format:fix`: Runs Prettier and fixes format issues across the repository.

- `pnpm test`: Executes Jest tests across the repository.

- `pnpm clean`: Cleans the project by removing `dist`, `node_modules`, and other build directories.

- `pnpm changeset`: Manages changelog generation and release preparation.
